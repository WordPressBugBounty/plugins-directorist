[Excellente plugin + themes](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellente-plugin-themes/)
I had previously tried Directorist with the Director theme and was extremely pleased with what they offered. But when I learned they had specific themes for the businesses I was trying to address, I didn't hesitate and contacted them. There's really a lot of work behind these plugins and themes. The support is very good, and I hope to stay in touch with them for a long time. Regards from Argentina

[Best plugin & Great support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-plugin-great-support-7/)
I already knew in advance (after testing a few plugins) that this would be the best for listing. But there were country specific and beginner specific problems, so I asked them for help. I never dreamed that such a helpful team could exist. They were patient, always responded quickly and managed to find a solution to everything, resulting in a perfect website. In the end, I learned a lot from them. Thank you very much and I wish the Directorist team all the best.
